cockpit-smartfancontrol v0.8.2

cockpit-smartfancontrol -- cockpit UI for SmartFanControl
======================= == ======= == === ===============

This plugin not heavily documented yet, but that is probably not necessary. It's a cockpit UI to use and
configure SmartFanControl from a web UI.

It uses cockpit-stdplgin as standard look and feel for this UI.

All settings be configured and current status can be read out.

That's all for now ...
